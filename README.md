Leiningen template for libraries with better release cycle.

## Usage

    lein new library com.example/<lib_name>

Among other improvements, the generated library uses an alternative release cycle:

1. Version in _project.clj_ is the latest released version. It's not decorated with `-SNAPSHOT`.
2. When you release it, you decide which version increment you are making and you run `lein release <segment>`,
   where `<segment>` is one of `:major`, `:minor`, `:patch`.
3. During `lein release` mentions of the version in _README.md_ are updated to the current one,
   as well as `Unreleased` section in _CHANGELOG.md_ is renamed to the current version.
  
Example:
- right now you have version `"1.2.3"` in your _project.clj_.
- That means that version `"1.2.3"` was released a while ago, and in the repository there are some new changes since that last release.
- You recall that you added a new nice feature that you want to release now, which means you'd like to release the current state of the codebase as `"1.3.0"`.
- You probably edit _CHANGELOG.md_ and describe the feature there, and commit it.
- You run `lein release :minor`, and it does for you:
  - Checks that there are no uncommitted changes.
  - Bumps the version in _project.clj_ from `"1.2.3"` to `"1.3.0"`.
  - Updates _CHANGELOG.md_: moves stuff from `## [Unreleased]` section to the new version's section.
  - Replaces mentions of `"1.2.3"` in _README.md_ with `"1.3.0"`.
  - Commits the changes.
  - Creates a tag "1.3.0".
  - Uploads the JAR to Clojars.
  - Does `git push`.
